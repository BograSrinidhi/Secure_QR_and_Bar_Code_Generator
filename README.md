# Secure_QR_and_Bar_Code_Generator
A desktop-based application developed using Python, Tkinter, qrcode, and python-barcode that enables secure generation of both QR codes and barcodes. This tool integrates a password-based access system to prevent unauthorized code generation. Users can input any text, which is then encoded into a QR code and a Code39 barcode, both saved as PNG files. The user-friendly GUI allows for secure data entry and file saving via dialog prompts, making it ideal for applications where controlled generation of scannable codes is essential (e.g., confidential data tagging, secure document verification).
